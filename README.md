# Populr.me API JS

The Populr javascipt module wraps the Populr.me API so that it can be used easily from a Node.js app. Currently, the module is based on Fermata, which makes it easy to encapsulate a REST API. Pull requests are welcome.


## Performing Common Tasks

See the README.md file in the module folder for documentation of the node module.

## Running the Sample App

To run the sample code, navigate into the example directory and run `sudo npm install`. Then run `coffee app.coffee`. 

*Note: If you're a member of the Populr internal team and would like to point the API at your local machine instead of https://api.populr.me/, run with the envionment option: `coffee app.coffee -e development`*
